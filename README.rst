WARNING
=======

This project is under heavy development is 1500% stable.  If you're interested in standing up a Garbaginator, please understand you are about to be filled with Garbage-flavored awesomeness over the intensively obfuscated and garbaginated code.

Introduction
=============

Garbaginator solves the problem in the Python community of being able to handle Garbage Collection at an Enterprise level. 

It does this by storing information on garbage fetched from all over town in special code objects called 'DumpTrucks'. These compress the object and then deposit it in clear water. Eventually that fills up and makes landfill. Dirt and trees and stuff is flung over the landfill and then we let kids play there.

For IJK 2011, the garbaginator framework came out over deep discussions involving Sake.
